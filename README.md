## Orc POG

A silly discord bot that will react on any message (that he has access/permission to) with a custom emote. 
If any word containing `pog` or `pogger` he will react with a reply "Poggers! <emote>"

## Install

- Create your application & bot on Discord Developer Portal
- Create an env variable (via a `.env` file for example) for your Token
- Update the values for `CUSTOM_EMOJI_NAME` and `CUSTOM_EMOJI_ID` for your server
- Deploy to your liking, on an external server or locally. Changing the `bot.py` to `bot.pyw` and you can run it in the background
